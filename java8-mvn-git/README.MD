h2. What
This is dockerbuild file using java8, maven and git
It clones an existing project from github
and then runs it using maven 

h2. Remarks
Requires some files to be present in the root folder.
For instance
jdk-8u131-linux-x64.tar.gz
...
(later also maven en git)

these are added to the gitignore folder for obvious reasons.
Download them and add them to the project root folder...
